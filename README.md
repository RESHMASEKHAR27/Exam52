Created a login form in MVC that accepts an email id and sends the password to the email. Then the user can log in using the auto-generated password. Once logged-in a browser, keep cookies for 1hr. So that if the user tries to access the login page within an hour will auto-login using the cookies. After 1hr, need to log in again.
